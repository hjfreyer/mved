Sometimes you need to rename a bunch of files at a time. Rather than running a bunch of "mv" commands, mved (pronounced "move ed") lets you fire up your editor with each file on its own line, and rename them all at once by editing the lines.

Especially cool to use macros to define repetitive renaming rules.
